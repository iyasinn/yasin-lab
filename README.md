# Minimalist Academic Website

A clean, typography-focused personal website.

## Design Philosophy

This website follows a research-focused, minimalist approach that prioritizes:

- **Speed & Performance**: No unnecessary animations, bloated JS frameworks, or heavy assets
- **Typography-First Design**: Clean, readable text with serif for body and sans-serif for headers
- **High Information Density**: Well-structured content optimized for research presentation
- **Academic "Lab" Aesthetic**: Simple, clean styling reminiscent of academic papers
- **Content Over Style**: Focus on communicating ideas rather than flashy design
